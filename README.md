# GANs

Simple Implementation of implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Tensorflow. In the notebook file the GAN are designed to generate similar images according to the training inputs. 

The reason I include this notebook is because the tutorial/code I found accessible on the internet is usually full of bugs or outdated. Thus I think it is extremely important to have a bug-free can ready-to-run version of it, to kick start further exploration on GANs.

The performance of GANs can varies depending on the setting of Dsicriminator & Generator (the network structure inside of it). I will try to improve the repository as I learn about ways of improving its performance.
